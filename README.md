# DisGo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ikkerens/DisGo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ikkerens/DisGo) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ikkerens/DisGo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ikkerens/DisGo) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ikkerens/DisGo?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ikkerens/DisGo) 

This was a learning project for me that I used to teach myself Go, while it contains most of the functions needed to make a simple bot I never bothered to fix some of the websocket recovery issues.
Instead, I urge you to look at https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo, as I have begun contributing there. This library has a very similar API but without some of the convenience methods, but is stable.
